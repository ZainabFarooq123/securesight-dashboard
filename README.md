## ðŸ’¡ Tech Decisions

- **Next.js 15**: Chosen for fast routing, built-in API routes, and React server components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables utility-first styling and rapid UI development.
- **Prisma ORM + SQLite**: Easy to configure and seed for local development. Prisma offers type-safe queries and database migration tools.
- **App Router (not Pages Router)**: Used the new App Router directory structure from Next.js for modularity and server components.
- **API Routes**: Used instead of external backend for simplicity during local and serverless deployment.
- **.env File**: Used to manage `DATABASE_URL` locally for Prisma.
